/**Function Declaratiobn */
/**
 * function callName(name): This declares a function named callName that takes one parameter, name.
  { ... }: The curly braces define the body of the function, which contains the code to be executed when the function is called.
  console.log('My name is' + name): This line prints a message to the console. The message is the string 'My name is' concatenated with the value of the name parameter.
    `Function Keyword`: The function keyword is used to define a function.
    `Function Name`: callName is the name of the function.
    `Parameter` : name is a parameter that the function expects. It's a placeholder for the value that will be passed to the function when it is called.
     `Function Body`: Inside the curly braces {}, the function body contains the statements that will be executed when the function is called.
